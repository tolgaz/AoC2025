# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025

> **Challenge:** Solve each day with a different programming language

⚠️ *Warning: Code quality may vary. Proceed at your own risk.*

> **Note:** AI (GitHub Copilot) is used to generate boilerplate, set up development environments, and assist with routine code patterns (loops, functions, etc.). All puzzle solutions and core logic are figured out and written by me.

## 📅 Progress

## 📝 Note

This project successfully explored 10 different programming languages over the first 10 days of Advent of Code 2025. As the puzzles have become increasingly complex and time-intensive, the challenge takes a break here—I might come back to it during romjulen. The repository stands as a demonstration of polyglot programming and problem-solving across diverse language ecosystems.

## 🎯 Languages Explored

✅ Python • Java • JavaScript • Ruby • Dart • Go • Kotlin • Swift • Rust • TypeScript
